# How to participate in the Beta Program
If you are interested in trying the beta builds of ProjectFNF, the best place to start is the discord server. Occasionally there will be a role giveaway for a beta tester role and you can download and give feedback on builds of ProjectFNF. Make sure to become a beta tester, you also need to have your GitHub account linked to your Discord account, or I will not allow you to be in the tests.
