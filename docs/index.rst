What is ProjectFNF?
ProjectFNF is a small lightweight engine for Friday Night Funkin' built by Aflacc. This engine is easy to add features and configure already existing ones. It is easy to pick up and understand how to use. To get started with using the engine, see [this](https://github.com/aflacc/ProjectFNF/wiki/Setup-Workspace) wiki page.
